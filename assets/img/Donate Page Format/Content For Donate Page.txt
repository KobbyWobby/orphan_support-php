There is no bigger suffering than being an Orphan.

Imagine yourself as children wearing torn, untidy clothes loitering around the streets all day, 
begging and pleading for money and then returning to no specific place and most importantly to no one. 
No family to take your care, no person to share your grief and no support to provide you a healthy, growing environment. 
Well, this is the ground reality how most orphans grow up and it isn't shocking that when these poor kids become adults, 
helplessness due to lack of education and then unemployment gets buried in them to an extent that they even choose wrong means like crime to sustain a living. 

This life eventually harms the society and drains down the blessing of being a human being.  
By adopting a child today, you can not only add happiness to your lives but can also provide the child with a new life. 
Un-biological or biological, the child you raise will always be your child and your family.  Adoption will also serve the society by returning them educated youth.
